This file will create a password for specific sites you may use. For example:
    My algorithm takes in any website name such as Facebook, birth year, and middle initial.
    Then the algorithm will reverse the birth year, take first two letters of the website name, and place middle initial at the end of the password.
    No need to remember your password to a website as you can just go back to my algorithm and insert your values and wil return the same password given the same values for same websites.
